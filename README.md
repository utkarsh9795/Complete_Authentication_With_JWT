# Complete Authentication with JWT

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application. The project is designed to guide developers in creating secure, token-based authentication systems for their web applications. It encompasses user registration, login, protected routes, and token management, demonstrating best practices in web security.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create an account by providing necessary details, which are validated and stored in a MongoDB database.
- **User Login**: Secure login mechanism that generates JWT tokens upon successful authentication.
- **Token Management**: Implementation of JWT for secure communication between client and server, including token expiration and refresh.
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware to protect certain routes and ensure that only authenticated users can access them.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to provide meaningful feedback during authentication processes.
- **Environment Configuration**: Easy configuration for different environments using environment variables.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Middleware**: Express middleware for route protection
- **Development Tools**: npm, Postman for API testing

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Complete-Authentication-with-JWT.git
   cd Complete-Authentication-with-JWT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to both the client and server directories and install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install

   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
   - Start the client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- **Register**: Send a POST request to `/api/auth/register` with the user details.
- **Login**: Send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` with credentials to receive a JWT.
- **Access Protected Routes**: Include the JWT in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token when accessing protected routes.

## API Documentation

The API endpoints are structured as follows:

- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticate user and return JWT
- **GET /api/protected**: Example protected route requiring a valid JWT
